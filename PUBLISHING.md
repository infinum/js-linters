# Publishing

Publishing is done via GitHub Actions using [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## How to Manually Trigger the Workflow:

1. Navigate to the Actions tab in GitHub repository.
1. Select `Release` workflow.
1. Click on the `Run workflow` dropdown button.
1. You'll see a field to input the branch or use the default set (master). You can simply proceed with the default or specify release branch explicitly.
1. Click `Run workflow` to execute the workflow manually on the specified branch.
